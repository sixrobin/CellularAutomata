The project features both 2D and 3D automata, with some presets, such as Conway's Game of Life, or all the 3D automata found in this article: https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2019/12/28/3d-cellular-automata-3/
Here's a link to a video showing all of the 3D automata in the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NzogVamz1s
